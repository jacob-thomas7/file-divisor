# File Divisor
</div>

A File Explorer alternative for Windows which supports viewing files by different categories.

## Description
File Divisor is based on the idea that users do not always want their files organized the same
way all the time. It could be frustrating if, for example, they originally decided to sort their
photographs into subdirectories based on their subject, but one day they decide they want to
see all photographs taken in a certain timeframe. In a traditional file system, they would have
to manually go through each subdirectory and check the date of each file.

With File Divisor, this process is taken care of automatically, quickly retrieving all the files
that match the specified categories, or "divisors." Multiple divisors and filters may be applied
simultaneously, allowing users to efficiently find the files they need.

## Getting Started
### Library

### Program
CMake version 3.12 or greater is required.

Simply run the provided <code>build.bat</code> file to compile the code. The resulting executables
can now be found in the root directory.

## System Requirements
* Windows

## Program Usage
File Divisor's core library is available here for use within C++ programs. This repository also
provides a command-line program—similar to <code>ls</code>—and a GUI program—much like File
Explorer—but with the sorting and filtering capabilities of File Divisor.
